						When the morning came, we<br>
						Were cleaning incense off your<br>
						Vinyl shelf 'cause we lost track of time again<br>
						Laughing with my feet in your lap<br>
						Like you were my closest friend<br>
						"How'd we end up on the floor anyway?"<br>
						You say<br>
						"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw top ros√©<br>
						That's how"<br>
						I see you every day now<br>
						<br>
						And I chose you<br>
						The one I was dancing with in New York<br>
						No shoes<br>
						Looked up at the sky and it was<br>
						The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me<br>
						And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was<br>
						The mark they saw on my collarbone<br>
						The rust that grew between telephones<br>
						The lips I used to call home<br>
						So scarlet, it was maroon<br>
						<br>
						When the silence came, we<br>
						Were shaking blind and hazy<br>
						How the hell did we lose sight of us again?<br>
						Sobbing with your head in your hands<br>
						Ain't that the way shit always ends<br>
						You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway<br>
						Carnations you had thought were roses<br>
						That's us<br>
						I feel you, no matter what<br>
						The rubies that I gave up<br>
						<br>
						And I lost you<br>
						The one I was dancing with in New York<br>
						No shoes<br>
						Looked up at the sky and it was maroon<br>
						The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me<br>
						And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was<br>
						The mark they saw on my collarbone<br>
						The rust that grew between telephones<br>
						The lips I used to call home<br>
						So scarlet, it was maroon<br>
						<br>
						And I wake with your memory over me<br>
						That's a real fuckin' legacy, legacy<br>
						(It was maroon)<br>
						And I wake with your memory over me<br>
						That's a real fuckin' legacy to leave<br>
						<br>
						The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me<br>
						And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet<br>
						It was maroon<br>
						The mark they saw on my collarbone<br>
						The rust that grew between telephones<br>
						The lips I used to call home<br>
						So scarlet, it was maroon<br>
						<br>
						It was maroon<br>
						It was maroon<br>
