					One night a few moons ago<br>
					I saw flecks of what could've been lights<br>
					But it might just have been you<br>
					Passing by unbeknownst to me<br>
					Life is emotionally abusive<br>
					And time can't stop me quite like you did<br>
					And my flight was awful, thanks for asking<br>
					I'm unglued, thanks to you<br>
					<br>
					And it's like snow at the beach<br>
					Weird, but fuckin' beautiful<br>
					Flying in a dream<br>
					Stars by the pocketful<br>
					You wanting me tonight, feels impossible<br>
					But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around<br>
					Like snow on the beach<br>
					<br>
					Like snow on the beach<br>
					Like snow on the beach<br>
					Like snow, oh<br>
					<br>
					This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen<br>
					I searched 'aurora borealis green'<br>
					I've never seen someone lit from within<br>
					Blurring out my periphery<br>
					My smile is like I won a contest<br>
					And to hide that would be so dishonest<br>
					And it's fine to fake it till you make it<br>
					Till you do<br>
					Till it's true<br>
					<br>
					Now it's like snow at the beach<br>
					Weird, but fuckin' beautiful<br>
					Flying in a dream<br>
					Stars by the pocketful<br>
					You wanting me tonight, feels impossible<br>
					But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around<br>
					Like snow on the beach<br>
					<br>
					Like snow on the beach<br>
					Like snow on the beach<br>
					Like snow, oh<br>
					<br>
					I can't speak, afraid to jinx it<br>
					I don't even dare to wish it<br>
					But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet<br>
					Now I'm all for you like Janet<br>
					Can this be a real thing, can it?<br>
					<br>
					Are we falling like<br>
					Snow at the beach<br>
					Weird, but fuckin' beautiful<br>
					Flying in a dream<br>
					Stars by the pocketful<br>
					You wanting me tonight, feels impossible<br>
					But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around<br>
					Like snow on the beach<br>
					Like snow on the beach<br>
					Like snow on the beach<br>
					Like snow<br>
					But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around<br>
					<br>
					Like snow on the beach<br>
					(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)<br>
					Like snow on the beach<br>
					(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)<br>
					(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)<br>
					(Down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)<br>
